# Library Project
This project takes an array of book objects and displays them in divs on the screen. 
A user can add a book by pressing a button and filling out a form. 
The css styling of the div will change depending on if the user marks if the book has been read or not. 

Fundamentals I've learned from this project: 

- Greater understanding of transversing the dom. 
- That text nodes are leaves but can be accessed because each node sets up essentially an array
  of its children. 
- accessing current style elements of nodes as a string via JS. 
- CSS GRID minmax and auto fill
- using forms and accessing fields from it via JS 
- positioning in CSS 
- DEBUGGING haha
